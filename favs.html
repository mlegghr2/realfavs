        <p id="favs-about">Here are some of my unpopular favorites. 
            They might be "too long" or "boring" or "who even reads that", 
            but I still root for them. This page is a bit longer but there are some bops here. </p>

        <h3>To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee</h3>
        <p>TKM may see like punishment to most 9th graders, but in reality, there is a reason why everyone has 
            to read it. It is a tale of a young girl trying to understand adult problems. Scout sees the world 
            through the eyes of a child and can't really see race. Jem, her older brother, and their father have
            the same "problem". As Scout's dad defends a black man in a case or rape, Scout and Jem get into 
            their own trouble. This story about family and equality in the deep south. <br> <br>
            <strong>Rating: 9/10 <br>Age rating:</strong> High school to adulthood. <br><br>
            This is a great story to remind us that all people are people. Even if the color of their skin is not 
            the reason that they are a "monster"
        </p>
        <h3>The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas</h3>
        <p>"The Count", as I like to call it, is one of my favorite books of all time (hence it is on the list of 
            my favorite books). I have only read the abridged adition, but it is amazing. The Count starts off as 
            a slow read, but it is so worth it. I suggest making a character chart when reading, as many people 
            come back. THis is a story about revenge and love. Basically what happens is this guy is going to 
            become a captain of a ship in post Napoleon France and his enemies are like, "no." He gets arrested 
            for following orders, and then he meets this old crazy preist who gives him a map to an island full 
            of precious gems. He escapes, finds it and gets revenge on everyone and helps some people who helped 
            him before his imprisonment, all while keeping his identity a secret. <br><br>
            <strong>Rating: 10/10 <br>Age rating:</strong> Highschool and older <br><br>
            This book is a classic that is actually good. Writen by the author of the three musketeers, I wish that 
            more people read it. Just writing about it makes me want to read it again.
        </p>
        <h3>The Giver by Lois Lowry</h3>
        <p>This may seem like a weird, unconnected series, but it's actually great. We will go in order discussing 
            the books. It should be noted that I haven't read these books for a while. This goes for most books on this page.</p><br><br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Giver</strong> The first book, and it is set in a dystopian society where 
                    everything feels wrong. There are so many weird rules that seem mormal to the characters, 
                    but are overbearing to the reader. It always seems off, and then the protag realizes something. 
                    I won't spoil anything else because it's weird but it's also great.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Gathering Blue</strong> This book gives you whiplash. You think that you'll follow the 
                    same story, but nah. There is another distopian society that is less odd, but not the same as 
                    what we know. I don't really remember what happens, but the town doesn't know how to make blue dye,
                    and the main character maybe goes on an adventure to find some, and more stuff happens.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Messenger</strong> This book follows the little boy from the first book. It's fine.
                    I honestly have no memory of this book. I feel like the kid just yells at his brother for warning 
                    him about stuff while the older brother is just trying to protect him.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Son</strong> A new person get caught up in this bunch. She is from the OG society. Her 
                    biological son was removed from her by force and sent away right after birth. She of course, was like
                    no give him back. So she tries to find him. She finds out that he's vibing with the other three protags.
                    It's great.
                </li>
            </ul> <br>
        <p>
            Honestly this is a great series that is just a look at what we should not let government become. <br>
            <strong>Rating: 10/10 <br>Age rating:</strong> All ages should read this, but seriously, fifth grade and up.
        </p>
        <h3>Illuminae by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff</h3>
        <p> Illuminae 
            is told through video and audio files that have been typed out and also text chats. The first book in the series 
            is about Ezra and Kady and their planet becoming over run by a giant evil tech company (the rest of the books 
            also involve said company). They get saved by the government but then they end up saving the government because 
            we all know by now that governments are incompitent. There is also a crazy AI that almost kills everyone but he 
            ends up being cool. <br><br>
            <strong>Rating: another 10/10 <br>Age rating:</strong> highschool <br><br>
            This book was hard to get used to, but once I was into it, I was down. Illuminae is a great book to read if you 
            have short time chuncks to read, because it is kind of blocky. With each scene separated by another file, it is 
            easy to separate them.
        </p>
        <h3>Wings of Fire</h3>
        <p>I all I can say is dragons. And sarcasm.<br><br>
            <strong>Rating: 10/10 <br> Age rating:</strong>fourth grade and up
        </p>
        <h3>The Lions of Little Rock</h3>
        <p>This is another classic tale from the deep south during segergation. This tale is about two girls, Marlee and Liz, 
            who become friends, even though society says no. Marlee is shy, where as the outgoing Liz gets her to talk. Liz 
            caught trying to pass as a white girl, and then things go down hill. Honestly, this book is so good that I got a 
            bit distracted while doing research (aka i read the book again). <br><br>
            <strong>Rating: 9/10 <br>Age rating:</strong> Probably fourth grade and up.
